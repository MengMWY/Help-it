    title: 'Fund 1000 Scholarships in Rural China for a Year',
    description: 'Some 200 million rural Chinese live below the poverty line by the World Bank definition of $1.25 per day, implying that 40 million school-aged children are at risk of dropping out of school before their high school graduation. In order to combat this huge waste of human capital, the SOAR Foundation, for the past 20 years, has provided 26,600 merit-based scholarships to more than 8,000 impoverished yet gifted students across rural China to finish high school and achieve success thereafter.',
