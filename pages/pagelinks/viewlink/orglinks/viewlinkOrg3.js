    description: "Hi... I’m Dan, Lydia's husband.\nIn September 2018, my family’s world changed in an unimaginable way.My wife Lydia, a fit, happy and healthy 41 - year - old and mum of our two young children, fell critically ill with Sepsis and an underlying infection of tuberculosis(TB).She spent 11 days in a coma on life-support close to death.I’m so thankful to say that she has survived against the odds.Unbelievably, she had to have both her legs amputated below the knee, together with the amputation of her right hand at the wrist and the fingers of her left hand, undergoing 5 major operations in the last 7 weeks.I’m hoping to raise funds to get the best possible prosthetics as I want to make sure Lydia can get back to doing what she loves and get her life back.",
